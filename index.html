    <h3 id="firstQ" class="myH3">How to make a cupcake?</h3>
    <div  class="subdiv2" id="duckdiv"><h2 class="ans">125g caster sugar
      125g butter, softened (or margarine)
      125g self raising flour
      2 large eggs
      1tsp vanilla essence
      And that’s it! How easy is that?! I quite often double up the recipe so that we make twice as many cakes. I figure if I’m making them anyway I may as well make 24 instead of 12. It’s not like they take long to get eaten!</h2></div>
