# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Links
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://hassan588.github.io/Frontend-Mentor-challenge/)

## My process
It took me three days to build this site and it is the first site I've built from scratch so you may see some problems.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

I learned a lot while building this project and I have much more to learn, the best thing I've learned is how to solve problems on my own and not by watching tutorials over and over without any implementation.


### Continued development
I'm going to focus on web development because I enjoy it, especially responsiveness and the grid system.

### Useful resources

-(https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is the most easy-to-understand website, it helped me with nearly everything.
